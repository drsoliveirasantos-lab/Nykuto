# Source of truth — Nykuto

This file defines what contributors and AI assistants must treat as authoritative in this repository.

## Project identity

Nykuto is a French professional-services brand with two coordinated business lines:

1. **Nykuto Digital** — simple, clear and responsive showcase websites.
2. **Nykuto Business International** — administrative organization, diagnostics and project coordination between France, Europe and Latin America.

The umbrella message is:

> Le digital et l’international, réunis pour faire avancer votre entreprise.

## Positioning rules

Nykuto is a consultancy and coordination business. It is not a bank, payment institution, acquirer, law firm or accounting firm.

When payment projects are discussed, Nykuto may:

- qualify business needs and flows;
- compare possible payment journeys;
- help prepare KYC/KYB information;
- coordinate onboarding with a regulated provider.

Nykuto must never claim to:

- hold or transmit funds for third parties;
- capture or store card data;
- guarantee merchant account acceptance, a virtual terminal, MOTO capability or payment limits;
- provide regulated legal, tax, accounting, banking or payment services.

## Branches

- `main` is the production branch.
- Use a short working branch for every meaningful change.
- Open a pull request before merging into `main`.
- Do not merge unless checks are green and the user validates the merge.

## Editable production sources

The current production source of truth is the static root site:

- root HTML pages;
- `styles.css`, `i18n.js` and `script.js`;
- `assets/`, `favicon.svg`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and `_headers`;
- `scripts/prepare-cloudflare-output.js`;
- `gestor/` for the private real-estate manager pilot interface;
- `functions/` for the Cloudflare Pages authentication and manager API;
- `migrations/` for the D1 manager schema;
- documentation in `docs/`;
- repository workflows and instructions in `.github/`.

`out/`, `dist/` and `.vercel/output/static/` are generated outputs and must never be edited directly.

The existing `app/`, `components/` and `data/` folders and the old layered CSS files are inactive scaffolding. They are not included in the production build. A future migration or cleanup must update this file and `docs/site-architecture.md` before those sources become authoritative or are removed.

## Commercial scope

Allowed digital positioning:

- one-page or small multi-page showcase websites;
- clear service presentation and contact paths;
- responsive design and basic technical SEO structure;
- simple external integrations such as Calendly or Tally when scoped.

Allowed international positioning:

- diagnostic and action plan;
- administrative organization;
- cross-border project coordination;
- research and comparison of service providers;
- remote or on-site training and transmission;
- coordination with regulated specialists.

Do not promise guaranteed SEO rankings, complex custom platforms, merchant acceptance or outcomes controlled by third parties.

## Trust rules

- No invented client, partner, certification, testimonial or performance figure.
- Illustrative cases must be labelled as scenarios or concepts.
- Confidentiality claims must match actual practice.
- Legal pages must contain confirmed publisher information before production publication.
- Sensitive personal information must not be committed to a public repository without explicit owner confirmation.

The real-estate manager pilot stores no plaintext credential in Git. Account
credentials, access periods and sessions are provisioned directly in Cloudflare;
protected routes must enforce both the session and the active pass on the server.

## Languages

- French is the editorial source of truth in the production HTML files.
- `i18n.js` provides the English, Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish interface and commercial-page translations.
- The selected language is preserved in the URL and local browser storage so navigation remains consistent across pages.
- Legal documents remain officially published in French. In another interface language, the site must display a clear notice that the French text is authoritative rather than presenting an unofficial translation as legally binding.

## Publication blockers and fiscal wording

- The recommended current VAT treatment is the French *franchise en base de TVA*, subject to confirmation from the competent SIE that no voluntary VAT option is active.
- Do not publish a definitive VAT status until that confirmation is obtained. Quotes and invoices must use the wording appropriate to the client's status and location; international B2B services must not automatically reuse the domestic franchise wording.
- The owner explicitly approved publication of the professional address `23 Mail des Bordelais, 33300 Bordeaux, France` and telephone number `+33 7 68 34 56 08` on 31 July 2026. Do not expand the address with an apartment number or reuse any other personal coordinate without a new explicit confirmation.
- A city, district or postcode alone is not an acceptable substitute for the full address in production legal notices.

## Documentation and validation

- `docs/brand.md` — visual and verbal identity.
- `docs/offers.md` — service lines, prices and boundaries.
- `docs/content-strategy.md` — audiences, messages and conversion logic.
- `docs/site-architecture.md` — active source and deployment structure.
